## Intrioduction

GQFn provided a *typed* way to create the GraphQL query.

It uses Typescript to check your query and provide output type.

## Why GQFn?

At first I just want to speed up the HMR of Cytoid.io, it usually coat more that 2 seconds before HMR before the GraphQL Codegen generate the codes for the new GraphQL queries (It also prevent the hmr if I haven't change any query just because I edit a page include GraphQL.)

After the development I found the GQFn have something balance between speed and bundle size:
- Traditional codegen: provide the query AST, but bundle size is large;
- raw query: no runtime check, bundle size is the smallest;
- use raw in prob, and codegen in dev: it actally provide the best bundle size and DX, but it makes the difference between dev and prod;
- GQFn: provide *raw query like* functions, generate the AST quickly in runtime, bundle size is similar to raw query.
