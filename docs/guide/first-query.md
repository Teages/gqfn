# First Query with GQFn

The experience of using gqfn is very similar to writing plain GraphQL queries. The following content assumes that you already know [how to write a GraphQL query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/).

In this guide, our goal is to gradually build a slightly complex query.

## Prepare the Schema

Before writing a query, you need to prepare the schema. Follow the guide in [Getting Started](./) to generate the schema types. and use `useSchema` to get the `gqfn` function. Here we use the endpoint from [AniList](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/).

If you haven't install `gqfn` yet, you can do it by running the following command:
```bash
# âœ¨ Auto-detect package manager
npx nypm install @gqfn/core
npm run gqfn add https://graphql.anilist.co
```

Then, you can import the `gqfn` function from `@gqfn/core` package and use it to create a query.

## Selection and Arguments

To build a selection on the `Query` type, you can pass the selection as the only argument of the `gqfn` function.

<<< @/snippets/first-query/init.ts{ts twoslash}

Ok let's add the first field to the selection. We want to get the title of the Anime with the id `127549`. We need to add the `Media` field to the selection with the `id` argument.

Pass the arguments as the first argument of the `$`, and the selection as the second argument. Now we got this:

::: code-group
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_1/query.ts{ts twoslash} [GQFn]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_1/query.graphql [GraphQL]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_1/response.json [Response]
:::

But we want to get the title of the Anime. We can add the `title` field to the selection. We have no need to pass any arguments to the `title` field so we can use the shorthand syntax, pass the selection as the only argument.

You can get the type hint when writing the query.

```ts twoslash [Query Builder]
/* eslint-disable eslint-comments/no-unlimited-disable */
/* eslint-disable */
import { useGQFnSchema } from '@gqfn/core'
import { request } from 'graphql-request'

const endpoint = 'https://graphql.anilist.co'
const gqfn = useGQFnSchema(endpoint)
// ---cut---
const query = gqfn([{
  Media: $ => $({ id: 127549 }, [
    'id',
    {
      title: $ => $([
// @noErrors
        '',
//       ^|
      ]),
    },
  ]),
}])
```

The media we want to get is an anime, so we can also add the type argument to the selection.

The full code is here, you can intuitively see that the writing experience is similar to GraphQL.

::: code-group
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_2/query.ts{ts twoslash} [GQFn]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_2/query.graphql [GraphQL]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_2/response.json [Response]

## Operation Name

The operation name should be always be the first argument of the `gqfn` function.

::: code-group
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_3/query.ts{ts twoslash} [GQFn]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_3/query.graphql [GraphQL]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_3/response.json [Response]
:::

## Variables

Variables are helpful if we want to query for other anime. You can pass the variables definition as the second argument of the `gqfn` function.

Writing variables is similar to writing a GraphQL query and you can use the `$` to visit you variables.

::: code-group
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_4/query.ts{ts twoslash} [GQFn]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_4/query.graphql [GraphQL]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_4/response.json [Response]
:::

Default values can be set as follows:

::: code-group
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_5/query.ts{ts twoslash} [GQFn]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_5/query.graphql [GraphQL]
<<< @/snippets/first-query/query_5/response.json [Response]
